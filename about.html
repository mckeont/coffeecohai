    <h1>From small farm Sài Gòn to a cup in your hands</h1>

    <p>
      Cà Phê Cô Hai began in the red earth and green fields outside of Sài Gòn, 
      where mornings started with roosters, the smell of wet soil, and the sound of coffee dripping 
      slowly through a <em>phin</em> filter. Growing up on a family farm, coffee wasn’t just a drink – 
      it was part of the rhythm of the day. We learned early that a good cup could wake you up, 
      warm you up, and bring people together around the same table.
    </p>
<br>
    <p>
      As we grew, so did our curiosity. We tasted everything we could – bright, fruity beans from the 
      highlands, deep and chocolatey roasts, bold Robusta that could carry you through a long day. 
      We paid attention to how the grind, the roast, the water, and the patience between each drip 
      changed the flavor in the cup. Little by little, sip by sip, we dedicated ourselves to 
      understanding what makes Vietnamese coffee truly the best.
    </p>
<br>
    <p>
      Cà Phê Cô Hai is our way of sharing that journey with you. Every recipe we serve is rooted in 
      those farm mornings – strong, authentic coffee taste, balanced with just the right sweetness and creaminess. 
      We focus on authentic methods and high-quality beans so that each drink feels like a small pause, 
      a deep breath, and a bright spark of energy.
    </p>
<br>
    <p>
      Whether you’re discovering Vietnamese coffee for the first time or coming back to a familiar taste 
      from home, we’re honored to brew for you. Thank you for letting us bring a piece of our farm, 
      our family, and our love for coffee into your day.
